# Next-Word-Predictor

 
Predict the next word in a sentence or text passage using the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Features

LSTM-Based Model: Employs LSTM architecture, known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in text.
Customizable Vocabulary: Train on your own dataset or use pre-trained models.
Flexible Prediction: Generate suggestions for single words or longer phrases.
Easy Integration: Use the included API or functions to incorporate word prediction into your own applications.

## Data Preprocessing
Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and converted into numerical representations.
Model Architecture: An LSTM model is defined, often including layers for embedding, LSTM cells, and output.
Training: The model learns from the text data, adjusting its parameters to minimize prediction errors.
Inference: The trained model takes a sequence of words as input and outputs probabilities for the next word. The word with the highest probability is selected.

## Customization
Model Hyperparameters: Experiment with different LSTM configurations, number of layers, learning rates, etc.
Training Data: Use diverse and relevant text sources to improve prediction accuracy.

### Example: 

Input:  "The weather is quite"

Output: "nice"

# Applications:
Next-Word-Predictor can be used for:

Autocomplete and text suggestion in writing tools
Enhancing chatbots and conversational AI
Improving language models and machine translation
Creative writing and brainstorming assistance
Future Potential: We envision extending this project to include:
Multilingual support
Domain-specific models (e.g., medical, legal)
Integration with speech recognition
